title: Two Pointers
---
# Introduction

Pointer in java is just index, because java does not have a true pointer. Two pointers algrithm is used for index-based data structure, esp. array or some lists.
In terms of direction of the two pointers, there are fast-slow-pointers, left-right-pointers. Sliding-window-pointers is a special case for fast-slow-pointers. The two pointers 
in fast-slow-pointers move in the same direction, one fast, the other slow, while the two pointers in left-right-pointers move in the different direction, left pointer
move to the right, and right-pointer move to the left. Sliding-window-pointers keep a window during the two pointers move.
